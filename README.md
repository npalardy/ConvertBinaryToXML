# ConvertBinaryToXML
A Xojo project to convert binary projects to XML

Based on previous work by several members of the RB/Xojo community I've created a small helper app 
that can convert most, if not all, binary projects to XML

There is a PDF document included from RBDocs.com that documents some aspects of the RBBF (binary) format
Thomas' Tempelmann's RB Project Tools repository (http://www.tempel.org/rb/#prjtool) has also been instructive in understanding the RBBF format
